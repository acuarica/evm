# Fixes line endings on Windows for Snapshot Testing, which was introduced in
# https://github.com/acuarica/evm/commit/d4cfa4f6351c665d467bbd6eec1d6d1680a1637c
#
# Snapshot Testing needs `console` output and file comparison to be left untouched,
# in particular line endings.
#
# `console` and the Node API use `\n` for line endings, see https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5038.
# `sevm` uses `\n` for multiline strings as well.
# Thus, `console` output and output files generated by `sevm` need to be compared using only `\n`,
# regardless of the OS.
#
# For reference, Jest, which supports Snapshot Testing, uses the same approach
